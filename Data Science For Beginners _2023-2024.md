## The complete Road map

## **Data Science:**
                It is the science that allows uncovering insights and trends in data through processing, analyzing and transformation that enhances decision-making making and revolutionalizing different technologies.
A data scientist should have a vast amount of knowlegde that revolves around data(this forms the fundamentals of data science) which include;
- Mathematical concepts
- statistics
- Programming concepts

## Mastering the fundamentals
### 1.Programming Skills
Python and R programming languages are mostly used in data processing. Available libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy come in handy and are of importance when learning python. R is mostly used for analysis (mostly spatial data) and modelling data.One should familiarise themselves in SQL which is used to store and manage vast amounts of data. 
### 2.Statistics
This is a type of math that allows one to collect and analyze data to find answers to various questions raised from the data. It forms the basis of machine learning and experiments on how data is related to each other e.g regression analysis, k-means clustering.
Another important concept in statistcs is **Probability** which is the numerical prediction of likelihood of an event occuring.
### 3.Data manipulation and exploratory data analysis
Manipulating and exploring data to gather insights, identify patterns visualizing the data with matplotlib of ggplot helps one communicate their findings easily by creating graphs and charts. Python's dataframe features allows for data manipulation functions and organizing data in rows and columns. Seaborn library package is recommended since it has additional functionalities such as heatmaps. From this, a data scientist can formulate hypothesis about the data.
### 4.Data Preprocessing 
Cleaning and preprocessing the data such as scaling and feature engineering( which involves selecting,transforming new features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models by splitting data into training and training sets for model evaluation).An example is the Principal Component Analysis model that involves finding the principal components of the data using linear algebraic transformations.
### 5.Predictive modelling
Experiment on the existing machine learning models amd choose the one thats best at solving the problem at hand.The model is selected according to various modeeling approaches;
- Regression-Based on numeric values
- Classification-Either the model is supervised or unspervised classification model
- Time Series-When one wants to compare results from a sensor and the data
- Clustering-when the data being dealt with is not assiciated with labels

Examples of these methods are; random forests and gradient boosting.
The techniques handle complex problems which is an advantage to scientist with knowledge in them.
### 6.Model evaluation and deployment
One ought to evaluate the model on the training dataset , compare the different metrics and decide on the best model. After evaluation deploy the model to a server or cloud platform and make it available for real-time inferencing. This paves way for improvement of the model from different stakeholders in its production line. One should learn frameworks such as Flask and Django for building web applications and cloud patforms like Google Cloud for scalable platforms.
### 8.Continous Learning
Since data science is an evolving field,it is important to stay up-to-date with the emerging technologies by following blogs, participating in bootcamps and attending conferences to expand your knowledge.
